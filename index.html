              <p>Hi, I'm Niha. I am a computer engineer studying at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada. Im currently in my last year of my degree and I'll be graduating in April 2021!</p>
              <p>I've had the chance to work at <a href= "https://www.dehavilland.com">Dehavilland</a> on the Q400 plane in the past, as well as work on design teams at Ryerson! You can find out more about my professional endeavours in the <link><a href="https://ndshetty.github.io/#work">Experience</a></link> section. :)
                I always love working with and meeting people in the industry</p>
              <p>When I'm not busy studying or writing up a lab report, I love to workout, read nonfiction books and go camping and portaging with my friends!</p>

              <h3>De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited: May 2019- September 2019         (North York, ON)</h3>
              <h3>Data Analyst</h3>
              <p><ul>De Havilland Aircraft of Canada is well known in the aerospace industry as the company that makes the Q400 series planes. Formerly known as Bombardier Aviation, I had the chance of working at Downsview Airport in the Technical Help Desk (THD) department. </ul></p>
              <p><ul>At THD, I had the chance of working on several impactful projects that improved the efficiency of tasks being done in the department</ul></p>
              <p><ul>1. Created a data extractor to populate Daily Morning Meeting (DMM) Performance charts to reflect the performance of various departments according to date. The data is extracted from IBM Lotus Notes and this software is currently being used by the THD on a daily basis. </ul></p>
              <p><ul>2. Automated and improvised the Vacation Tracker to be able to display the list of vacation days remaining/taken by each employee. Some of the additional features (buttons) added were to save monthly/yearly schedule as PDF and automatically email monthly/yearly schedule with a PDF of the schedule to employees in the department. It improved labour efficiency from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes</ul></p>
              <p><ul>3. Assisted in the transition of Bombardier Aviation’s Q Series Technical Help Desk to the newly formed De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited by modifying important documents and files to match DHC.</ul></p>

              <h3>Ryerson Cansat: September 2017- September 2020         (Toronto, ON)</h3>
              <h3>Team Captain</h3>
              <p><ul>Ryerson Cansat is an engineering design team at Ryerson that participates in the 
                NASA sponsored International CanSat competition in Blacksburg, Virginia. </ul></p>
                        
              <p><ul>The main objective of the CanSat competition is to design a miniature satellite- usually the size of a soda can. The main functions of the satellite
                include obtaining the altitude, air pressure, temperature, time, GPS longitude and latitude as well as the software state (which is essentially the operating state of the software- launch, ascent, rocket separation, descent, etc.)
                You can learn more about the specifics of the competition here: <a href= "http://www.cansatcompetition.com/index.html">CANSAT.</a></ul></p>
              
              <p><ul>I have been on the electronics team of Ryerson CanSat as a member since 2017 and was chosen to be the team captain in 2019. </ul></p>  
              
              <p><ul>During my time as captain, I led 30+ engineering students from multiple engineering disciplines to design and build the CanSat, as well as manage all the administrative work to maintain the team within the Ryerson community. 
                I also managed all electronic subteams including Flight Software, Ground Software, PCB (printed circuit board) Design and Sensor Integration as well as Power. 
                These subteams use MATLAB, C/C++ and Eagle CAD to build the electronic structure of the CanSat. 
                In addition, I have organized several training sessions to familiarize new members with the basics of Arduino and Eagle CAD.</ul></p>

              <h2>2020</h2>

              <h3>Webscraper</h3>
              <p><ul>Currently in the process of creating a COVID-19 Daily Case tracker of Ontario by extracting data from public sources and
                storing in MySQL database. The data is to be displayed on a web-app to display the total case counts per day according to
                regions in Ontario. </ul></p>
              <p><ul>You can view my progress <a href= "https://github.com/ndshetty/Webscraper">here!</a></ul></p>

              <h3>Path Finding Autonomous Robot System: Final Year Thesis</h3>
              <p><ul>The main objective of my final year capstone project is to design and implement a multi-sensor and LiDAR based path
                finding autonomous exploration robot system. The robot we are using is the Ryerson Rams Robotics Mars Rover.</ul></p>
              <p><ul>On the project, my main tasks are to implement a software system which employs obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance algorithms using the LiDAR. I am currently working on these algorithms in Python</ul></p>
              <p><ul>You can view our progress on the <a href= "https://github.com/GabeCasciano/Capstone20">repository!</a></ul></p>
              
              <h3>1 Bit Full Adder</h3>
              <p><ul>Currently implementing a Full Adder using logical NOR and NAND gates on Cadence. The schematic and
                layouts of the gates are also going to be designed individually and combined to form the Adder. The layout will be verified using transient analysis and simulation. </ul></p>
              <p><ul>You can view my progress <a href= "https://github.com/ndshetty/1bitFullAdder">here!</a></ul></p>

              <h3>Multilayer Neural Network</h3>
              <p><ul>Created a 2-2-1 Neural Network that performs the XOR operation using the back
                propagation algorithm to classify linearly non-separable data. The project is linked <a href= "https://github.com/ndshetty/MultiLayerNeuralNetwork">here!</a></ul></p>
             
              

              <h2>2019</h2>

              <h3>Ping Pong Game</h3>
              <p><ul>Created a Ping Pong game using VHDL to run on the Spartan 3E FPGA board by implementing custom logic
                circuits on the real-time high performance signal generators on the FGPA, and interfacing it with I/O devices such as
                the monitor and controller. This was a two-player game and controlled by the switches on the FPGA board. If the ball was missed and went out of bounds, then the ball turned red.</ul></p>
              <p><ul>The project is linked <a href= "https://github.com/ndshetty/PongGame--">here!</a></ul></p>

              <h3>Cache Controller</h3>
              <p><ul>Created a Cache Controller using VHDL on the Spartan-3E FPGA Board. The objective of this project was to implement a block responsible for copying code or data from main memory to cache memory automatically. 
                It implemented static RAM (SRAM) and synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) components as well as other custom logic controllers and memory units. The project was tested using the ChipScope Pro Tool by verifying the waveforms.</ul></p>
              <p><ul>The project is linked <a href= "https://github.com/ndshetty/CacheControl">here!</a></ul></p>


              <h2>2018</h2>

              <h3>Banking Application</h3>
              <p><ul>Created a Banking App in Java and Java FX to replicate online banking transactions. 
                Functionalities include creating new users accounts. These users could log in/out of their accounts as well as deposit/withdraw money from their account.
                All the accounts were also controlled by a manager that were able to log in/ log out into user accounts. 
                Features that the Manager could control were adding/deleting customers and adding/withdrawing money from the account. 
                Each customer was also given a rating based on the amount of money in their account- Gold, Silver and Platinum.</ul></p>
              <p><ul>The project is linked <a href= "https://github.com/ndshetty/Banking-App">here!</a></ul></p>
